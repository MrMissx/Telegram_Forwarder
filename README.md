# Telegram Forwarder

A simple Telegram Python bot running on Python3 to automatically forward messages from one chat to another.

## Migration from V1

v2 uses a different configuration file format. Please refer to the [Configuration](#configuration) section for more information. The bot will not start if the configuration file is not in the correct format.

## Starting The Bot

Once you've setup your your configuration (see below) is complete, simply run:

```shell
python -m forwarder
```

or with poetry (recommended)

```shell
poetry run forwarder
```

## Setting Up The Bot (Read the instruction bellow before starting the bot!):

Telegram Forwarder only supports Python 3.9 and higher.

### Configuration

There are two files mandatory for the bot to work `.env` and `chat_list.json`.

#### `.env`

Template env may be found in `sample.env`. Rename it to `.env` and fill in the values:

- `BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram bot token. You can get it from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

- `OWNER_ID` - An integer of consisting of your owner ID.

- `REMOVE_TAG` - set to `True` if you want to remove the tag ("Forwarded from xxxxx") from the forwarded message.

#### `chat_list.json`

Template chat_list may be found in `chat_list.sample.json`. Rename it to `chat_list.json`.

This file contains the list of chats to forward messages from and to. The bot expect it to be an Array of objects with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "source": -10012345678,
    "destination": [-10011111111, "-10022222222#123456"]
  },
  {
    "source": "-10087654321#000000",  // Topic/Forum group
    "destination": ["-10033333333#654321"]
  }
]
```

- `source` - The chat ID of the chat to forward messages from. It can be a group or a channel.

  > If the source chat is a Topic groups, you **MUST** explicitly specify the topic ID. The bot will ignore incoming message from topic group if the topic ID is not specified.

- `destination` - An array of chat IDs to forward messages to. It can be a group or a channel.
  > Destenation supports Topics chat. You can use `#topicID` string to forward to specific topic. Example: `[-10011111111, "-10022222222#123456"]`. With this config it will forward to chat `-10022222222` with topic `123456` and to chat `-10011111111` .

You may add as many objects as you want. The bot will forward messages from all the chats in the `source` field to all the chats in the `destination` field. Duplicates are allowed as it already handled by the bot.

### Python dependencies

Install the necessary python dependencies by moving to the project directory and running:

```shell
poetry install --only main
```

or with pip

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all necessary python packages.

### Launch in Docker container

#### Requrements

- Docker
- docker compose

Before launch make sure all configuration are completed (`.env` and `chat_list.json`)!

Then, simply run the command:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

You can view the logs by the command:

```shell
docker compose logs -f
```
